What if I told you, E V E R Y T H I N G you have been lead to believe, is a lie? The truth is unimaginable, uncomprehendable: https://youtu.be/d35HnXGuIt4
The Hum sounds like a background sound, similar like electronics makes in Star Trek, coincidence? https://youtu.be/3WXUOLHp54w - https://youtu.be/DydIK14AvXI
The stages of ME (they work fast, unless the person is not an ignorant), when a commoner realizes some ME change: 1. disbelief, 2. arguing, 3. confusion, 4. acceptance, 5. ignorance, 6. annoyance (if pursued further).
My theory? Our bodies in cryosleep, but our brains working in a shared virtual reality. We can change, whatever we want, as long as it affects only us. Literally: One persons freedom ends where another persons freedom begins.

The third eye refers to the gate that leads to inner realms and spaces of higher consciousness. http://cescos.fau.edu/observatory/lightpol-melatonin.html
Decalcifying one's pineal gland "opens up" the third eye. Supplemental melatonin may help one regarding opening up their third eye. https://www.jamiesonvitamins.com/products/melatonin-10-mg-dual-action-time-release
The pineal gland begins to calcify due to the harmful effects of artificial substances such as flouride chemicals found in public water systems and toothpaste, hormones and additives put into processed foods and sugars and artificial sweeteners dumped into soft drinks.
Cell phones are also being pinpointed as being harmful to the pineal gland due to high concentrations of radiation. Blue light produced by electronics, TVs and cell phones prevents pineal gland from producing melatonin causing problems and amongst other things also cancer.

ME rules
Copy/paste will change too, experienced it myself with Curious&curiouser youtube's channel.
ME seems to have a lot of people, who rush to its defense and blame it on a bad memory, pulling out various made up facts.
Many people are actually affected by ME, but they quickly dismiss it and if asked about it, they get irritated, even upset.
There is no way, you could find a real photo or a video of something affected by ME, since it never existed, in this reality.
Flip-flops make comments and posts about it disappear, since it "never" happened. And once it flip-flops back, it is the "new" ME.
ME is unable to change drawings, toys or replicas made from memory, not by copying (looking at it, while drawing, probably matters). 
ME is not entirely a simulation, otherwise residue would change too, there is some independence involved, probably in some characters, like people aware of ME. 
ME never affects people closely related to it (short-term memory?), like changes in bodies are not noticed by doctors, changes in planes by pilots, thus ME is not a random event. That means, that is done for a purpose by someone or something intelligent.
ME changes go back throughout the history, but ME is unable to change the residue before the change, thus it is not really time related, it is limited, what is done is done. It does not change the history, it merely replaces the public memory of it, to match the changes.
People might be remembering ME because of a personal memory. Like when I watched "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and I searched for the older version for comparison, I could not find it, because the links for the new one always poped up first, since as a remake, it was called the same, so I had to search for it using the year. It it were called "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory", I would not have that problem.  

ME quotes I find interesting
Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016) - In the gardens of memory. In the palace of dreams. That is where you and I will meet. But a dream is not reality. Who’s to say which is which?
Arthur Conan Doyle - Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.
Next Gen (2018) - 7723 - Listen. Our memories make us, who we are. Do not let the bad ones stop you from making good ones. Go make new memories.
Next Gen (2018) - Mai - You were trying to tell me and I, ... those memories were all you had and you give them up ... for me. I am sorry.
Star Trek Voyager - Mind of a Sparrow Leonardo da Vinci - There may be certain realities beyond limits of your comprehension.
Terminator Salvation (2009) - What is it that makes us human? It's not something you can program. You can't put it into a chip. It's the strength of the human heart. The difference between us and machines.
Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) - In this room all of my dreams become realities... and some of my realities become dreams.
Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) - Pure Imagination - https://youtu.be/SVi3-PrQ0pY
Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) - We are the Music-Makers, We are the Dreamers of Dreams.

ME
Who? Someone or something intelligent, most likely bored. The point is, it is not a random event, like a black hole or whatever.
How? Ripples in the water.  ME changes are not instantaneous, it goes step by step, multiple levels, probably because an instantaneous change would take an enourmous computer/will power? An example: the duke of Weseltown, his monocle has disappeared years after the original monocle's man change and references to it, thus the author could not have been inspired by them.
Why? Some for fun. like changing letters or fonts to addding neck-beards to lions and people or moustaches to horses. Then again some are more serious, like changes to planes, it seems, that they are trying to introduce some technologies sooner, because if those were introduced now, it would take decades, till they would be implemented, maybe because we are running out of time?! Like electric cars were introduced 200 years ago and yet they are still not widely used.

Red pill or blue pill?! You might think, that you would grab the red one for sure, but where/what would it get you? Maybe we have already made the choice, now we just want to understand it, but that would bring us back to the beginning and it would start all over. Sometimes it is better to forget, how many wish, they would have never found out about ME?! Ignorance is a bliss. https://youtu.be/OLv6ycYcpGI

Once ME becomes generally accepted, the truth will be revealed, till then, ME will only shows us the door, but we have to choose to go through.
Foot note: I have no doubt about ME anymore, ME itself provided the evidence. When plane's engines moved forward, I went through hundreds of photos looking at wings, to find some old planes with engines as they used to be, then again checking out winglets. 2 days later, pods were added, I went through the same photos again, pods were on all of them. That was as fresh ME/memory as it could possibly be. :)
Flat Earth proves, that we live in an enclosed environment. Moon landings prove, that we do not live in a simulation, because if we did, they could easily make another ones, but they can not, because as NASA stated, they lost the technology to get past Van Allen radiation belt. EDIT: That is no longer a problem, since the Moon is within Earth's atmosphere as of now, just like the Sun is white as well, rofl.

The Mandala: Why Do Monks Destroy It? Because the underlying message of the mandala ceremony is that nothing is permanent. Nothing. All things are in flux, it says, beautiful but ephemeral, moving but temporary, a plateau but not a summit. All things are called to balance and enlightenment and the fulfillment of the Divine image in them, yes, but in flux. Always in flux.

Total Recall (2012)
Doug Quaid: I want to remember.
Matthias: Why?
Doug Quaid: So I can be myself, be who I was.
Matthias: It is each man's quest to find out who he truly is, but the answer to that lies in the present, not in the past. As it is for all of us.
Doug Quaid: But the past tells us who we've become.
Matthias: The past is a construct of the mind. It blinds us. It fools us into believing it. But the heart wants to live in the present. Look there. You'll find your answer.

Star Trek Voyager Sacred Ground Transcript - http://www.chakoteya.net/Voyager/223.htm
The ritual, the life!? People are trying to fulfill their roles, that they have created for themselves.
There you go again, always looking for a rational explanation. Well there isn't one. Everything you do is meaningless. Let all of that go.
If you believe you're ready, then you are. There's no more to it than that. But if you go in with any doubt, with any hesitation, then you're dead.
Do not try to change ????? That's impossible. Instead... only try to realize the truth. There is no reality (time), thus the reason ME changes are NOT instantaneous (Like The added to Matrix Revolutions days after IMDb).

[Waiting Room]
(There are pensioners sitting on a bench by the wall.) 
OLD MAN 1: Who are you? 
JANEWAY: I'm Kathryn Janeway. Is this where the ritual begins? 
OLD MAN 2: Oh, the ritual. Yes. 
OLD WOMAN: We're waiting. Come, join us. 
JANEWAY: What exactly are you waiting for? 
OLD MAN 2: Just waiting. 
JANEWAY: How long have you been sitting here? 
OLD MAN 2: How long has it been? 
OLD MAN 1: Why are your asking me? I've lost track. 
OLD MAN 2: It's been a while. I know that. 
OLD WOMAN: Oh, it's been as long as we can remember. 
JANEWAY: Are you telling me I have to wait a lifetime before I can go through the ritual? 
OLD MAN 1: I didn't hear anyone say that, did you? 
OLD MAN 2: Certainly not. All we said was that we're waiting. 
JANEWAY: I'm just trying to understand how this works. The monks I saw in the sanctuary were young. They couldn't have waited such a long time to go through their rituals. 
OLD WOMAN: She's right about that, you know. 
OLD MAN 2: She's a smart one. 
OLD MAN 1: She thinks she is, at any rate. 
JANEWAY: This is a test of some kind, isn't it. To prove my determination. 
OLD WOMAN: A test? She thinks we're a test. What is she talking about? 
OLD MAN 2: She must like tests. I suppose tests make sense to her. 
JANEWAY: Has anyone ever tried to open this door? 
OLD MAN 1: How many times do we have to tell you that we are waiting? 
OLD WOMAN: My dear, why don't you just sit down and relax? You're much too tense. 
OLD MAN 2: You're welcome to wait with us. 
JANEWAY: I don't want to wait. I have a friend who's depending on me. I have to go through the ritual. 
OLD MAN 1: I wonder if she's always this impatient. 
OLD MAN 2: Oh, she's just determined. She wants to get on with it. 
OLD WOMAN: Seems to me she could be friendly and sit for a few minutes. 
OLD MAN 2: Oh no, she knows what she wants to do. She's not the kind to sit around when she has a mission to accomplish. 
(Janeway tries to open the door at the other end of the room.) 
OLD MAN 1: I told you. I told you it was locked. 
(Janeway knocks on the door three times and it opens.) 
GUIDE: Yes? 
JANEWAY: I mean no disrespect, but unless there's something I'm supposed to accomplish here, I'd like to continue with the ritual. 
GUIDE: By all means.
...
[Coastline]
(Waves rolling onto a rocky shore with a cliff behind Janeway.) 
JANEWAY: What is this? An hallucination? 
GUIDE: I'm only here to serve as a voice, an interpreter for the Ancestral Spirits. 
JANEWAY: I see. If there are other beings here, could I see them myself? 
GUIDE: You mean you want proof that we exist. 
JANEWAY: That would be helpful. 
GUIDE: It's irrelevant. 
JANEWAY: I don't want to be disrespectful. I've gone through every part of the ritual that I've been asked to. 
GUIDE: Everything you've gone through is meaningless. You've been told that. 
JANEWAY: I know. I just want to bring this to completion, to make my request. 
GUIDE: Then by all means do so.
...
[Sickbay]
EMH: No. I'm sorry, Captain, but it appears that everything you went through was meaningless.

[Sanctuary]
JANEWAY: You meant what you said, didn't you? Everything I went through was meaningless. 
GUIDE: Yes. 
JANEWAY: I did everything you asked of me. You led me to believe that would allow me to help Kes. 
GUIDE: I haven't led you anywhere, Kathryn. You've taken me along wherever you wanted to go. This was your ritual. You set these challenges for yourself. 
JANEWAY: It's true that I came here with certain expectations. Are you saying that you simply fulfilled my expectations? 
GUIDE: You'd have settled for nothing else. 
JANEWAY: I'm not ready to give up. If there's still a way to save Kes I want to try. 
GUIDE: You've come back to seek the spirits. 
JANEWAY: I don't know what I'm seeking. 
GUIDE: Then I believe you are ready to begin. 

[Waiting room]
OLD MAN 1: Well, look who's come back. So, your little adventure didn't quite work out the way you'd planned it. You put yourself through a lot of trouble and for nothing, didn't you. 
OLD MAN 2: Oh, don't feel bad. You wouldn't believe some of the things people have done to themselves on their way to seek the spirits. 
JANEWAY: There is no real ritual after all. 
OLD MAN 2: Real is such a relative term. Most of the challenges in life are the ones we create for ourselves. 
OLD WOMAN: And you are particularly hard on yourself, aren't you. 
JANEWAY: I've always been driven to succeed. 
OLD MAN 1: Stubborn, I'd say. You didn't really consider sitting and waiting with us, did you? 
JANEWAY: Well, I'm here now and I'm asking for your help. I want to understand the purpose of waiting in this room. 
OLD WOMAN: But isn't it enough to sit and be sociable? We're good company. 
JANEWAY: That's what I'm supposed to do. Talk to the Ancestral Spirits. 
OLD WOMAN: First we were a test, and now we're the Ancestral Spirits. 
JANEWAY: Are you? 
OLD MAN 1: That would be nice and quantifiable for you, wouldn't it. If the spirits were something you could see and touch and scan with your little devices. 
OLD MAN 2: If you can explain everything, what's left to believe in? 
JANEWAY: I know it's an important part of your religion to trust the spirits without question, but I wasn't brought up that way. It's hard for me to accept. 
OLD MAN 1: So much for your tolerant open-minded Starfleet ideals. 
JANEWAY: There's a difference between respecting the spiritual beliefs of other cultures and embracing them myself. 
OLD MAN 1: Fine. Don't embrace a thing. It's all the same to us. Go on back to your ship and play with your molecular microscanner. 
OLD WOMAN: You've tried all that already, but it didn't work, did it. Kes didn't get better. 
JANEWAY: No, she didn't. 
OLD WOMAN: Why not? 
JANEWAY: The Doctor couldn't explain it. 
OLD WOMAN: So it's inexplicable. A miraculous non-recovery. 
JANEWAY: We haven't found the reason yet. 
OLD WOMAN: But of course you will. You'll find all the answers eventually, with enough time and study, and the right sort of tools. That's what you believe isn't it as a scientist? 
OLD MAN 1: Be honest. 
JANEWAY: Yes, that's what I've always believed. 
OLD MAN 2: Even when her science fails right before her eyes she still has full confidence in it. Now there's a leap of faith. 
OLD WOMAN: Unconditional trust. Now that's promising. 
JANEWAY: All right. If you're saying that science won't help Kes, what will? 
OLD MAN 1: You won't like it. 
JANEWAY: I'm willing to do whatever's necessary. 
OLD MAN 1: Kill her. She's as good as dead already, finish the job! Give her another jolt of that what do you call it, biogenic field. 
OLD WOMAN: That would do it. 
JANEWAY: It would do what, exactly. 
OLD MAN 1: There you go again, always looking for a rational explanation. Well there isn't one. Your orbital scans and medical research have given you the facts, and they tell you the biogenic field is lethal. 
OLD WOMAN: If you believe the facts. 
OLD MAN 2: Let all of that go, Kathryn. Take Kes back into the shrine and trust the spirits to return her soul. 
JANEWAY: The ritual I went through is meaningless, and Kes has done nothing to prepare herself. How could either of us be ready to go through the field? 
OLD MAN 2: If you believe you're ready, then you are. There's no more to it than that. 
OLD MAN 1: But if you go in with any doubt, with any hesitation, then you're both dead. So, what are you going to do, Captain? 
JANEWAY: You know I won't stand by and watch Kes die if there's anything I can do to save her. I want to believe it's possible. I'm going to try.
